   Common Error: "Service is not ready for testing"
   Root Cause: LoggerService dependency injection issue preventing proper service startup

3. SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE
   Status: üîß PARTIALLY WORKING
   - Health endpoint: ‚úÖ WORKING (http://localhost:3000/health)
   - Service startup: ‚úÖ WORKING
   - LoggerService: ‚ùå NOT WORKING (dependency injection issue)
   - Product endpoints: ‚ùå NOT WORKING (due to logger issue)

================================================================================
                                ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED
================================================================================

1. ‚úÖ BUILD ERRORS - RESOLVED
   Problem: Multiple TypeScript compilation errors
   Solution: Fixed logger signature issues across all services
   Status: RESOLVED

2. ‚úÖ LOGGER SIGNATURE ERRORS - RESOLVED
   Problem: Logger calls using incorrect signature
   Solution: Updated all logger calls to use (message: string, meta?: Record<string, unknown>)
   Status: RESOLVED

3. ‚úÖ OBJECTID TYPE ERRORS - RESOLVED
   Problem: TypeScript errors with MongoDB ObjectId types
   Solution: Added proper type casting and null checks
   Status: RESOLVED

4. ‚ùå LOGGERSERVICE DEPENDENCY INJECTION - PENDING
   Problem: LoggerService not being injected properly
   Error: "this.logger.info is not a function"
   Impact: All product endpoints failing
   Status: PENDING RESOLUTION

================================================================================
                                TECHNICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

SERVICE STATUS:
- ‚úÖ NestJS application starts successfully
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint responds correctly
- ‚úÖ Basic routing works
- ‚ùå LoggerService injection fails
- ‚ùå Product endpoints return 500 errors
- ‚ùå E2E tests cannot run due to service errors

LOGGER ISSUE ANALYSIS:
- LoggerService is properly defined with correct method signatures
- LoggerModule exports LoggerService correctly
- AppModule imports LoggerModule correctly
- Issue appears to be runtime dependency injection problem
- Winston logger may not be properly initialized

BUILD STATUS:
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ All logger signature issues resolved
- ‚úÖ All type errors resolved
- ‚úÖ Application builds without errors

================================================================================
                                TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY
================================================================================

STRUCTURE VALIDATION TESTS:
‚úÖ Test utilities working correctly
‚úÖ Mock data validation passing
‚úÖ Vietnamese price format validation working
‚úÖ Response format validation working
‚úÖ No hallucination validation working
‚úÖ Product data quality checks passing
‚úÖ Test environment setup correct

END-TO-END TESTS:
‚ùå All E2E tests failing due to service unavailability
‚ùå Cannot test actual API functionality
‚ùå Cannot validate RAG system integration
‚ùå Cannot test Gemini API integration
‚ùå Cannot test Qdrant vector search

================================================================================
                                RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Priority: HIGH)
1. Fix LoggerService Dependency Injection
   - Investigate Winston logger initialization
   - Check for circular dependencies
   - Verify LoggerService is properly exported/imported
   - Test LoggerService injection in isolation

2. Verify Service Endpoints
   - Test product endpoints after logger fix
   - Verify RAG service integration
   - Test Gemini API connectivity
   - Test Qdrant vector database connectivity

MEDIUM PRIORITY
3. Run E2E Tests
   - Execute full test suite after service fixes
   - Validate all test scenarios
   - Document any remaining issues

4. Performance Testing
   - Run performance tests
   - Validate response times
   - Test concurrent requests

LOW PRIORITY
5. Documentation
   - Update API documentation
   - Create deployment guide
   - Document test procedures

================================================================================
                                NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE (Today)
   - [ ] Debug LoggerService dependency injection
   - [ ] Test LoggerService in isolation
   - [ ] Fix Winston logger initialization
   - [ ] Verify all product endpoints work

2. SHORT TERM (This Week)
   - [ ] Run complete E2E test suite
   - [ ] Fix any remaining test failures
   - [ ] Validate RAG system functionality
   - [ ] Test Gemini API integration

3. MEDIUM TERM (Next Week)
   - [ ] Performance testing
   - [ ] Load testing
   - [ ] Security testing
   - [ ] Documentation updates

================================================================================
                                CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The test execution revealed that the application structure and test infrastructure are
working correctly, but there's a critical LoggerService dependency injection issue
preventing the service from functioning properly.

Key Findings:
‚úÖ Test infrastructure is properly configured and working
‚úÖ Application builds successfully without errors
‚úÖ Basic service startup and routing work
‚úÖ Health endpoint responds correctly
‚ùå LoggerService dependency injection fails
‚ùå Product endpoints return 500 errors due to logger issue
‚ùå E2E tests cannot run due to service unavailability

Priority Action: Fix the LoggerService dependency injection issue to enable
comprehensive testing of the RAG product consultation system functionality.

The system is very close to being fully functional - only the logger issue needs
to be resolved to enable complete testing and validation.
